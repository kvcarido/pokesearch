# PokÃ©Search

Some sort of search or guessing game with the OG 151 PokÃ©mon!

## Introduction

I wanted to solidify my learning of asynchronous JS by creating something outside of tutorial hell. This project is a fun way to practice API calls and manipulating the DOM to show results.

Put your knowledge to the test and see how many pokÃ©mon you can name!

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The structure and functionality was built from scratch using good ol' HTML and vanilla JavaScript, with styling provided by NES.css ðŸ‘¾
